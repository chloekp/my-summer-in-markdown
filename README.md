## Introduction
My name is Chloe and I am a sophomore this year at Chatsworth. I am the youngest in my family of four and I have one older sister and two dogs named Oreo and Kiwi. I play volleyball and my favorite color is purple.
## Summer Activities
This summer, I went the Water Lantern Festival in Simi Valley with my family. We drew pictures on paper lanterns then put them in the lake after sunset. We got *so* many bug bites, but it was still beautiful to see. [Click here for info about the Water Lantern Festival](https://www.waterlanternfestival.com/venturacounty.php)
## Summer Travel
Early in the summer, I went to Orlando, Florida for a volleyball tournament. From there, my family went to Montreal, Canada to see family. We went to a lot of malls there and I ended up getting a Pandora charm bracelet there. We also walked around downtown Montreal and took a *long* walk to the Port of Montreal.
## Summer Sports
In Orlando, my team played at the AAU Junior Nationals. It was the last tournmanet that my team would be playing together so we all tried hard to play our best. We ended up finishing with a record of 9 wins and 2 losses and placed in the top 10 of our division. Once I got back, I started high school practice the second week of July. We have been practicing ever since and are preparing to go to Las Vegas for another tournament. During the summer, we played in a lot of leagues and tournaments and ended up winning the Burroughs' league after beating Cleveland.
## Favorite Summer Food
Duirng my trip to Montreal, I tried so many good foods that it's hard to pick just one favorite.
- Poutine is a Canadian dish made up of french fries, gravy, and cheese curds. Sometimes other toppings are added, but I love the classic
- Beaver tails are a desert unique to Canada. I would say its like a flattened donut with sweet toppings put on top, like frosting or Nutella. There are a ton of different flavors and it really satisfied my sweet tooth.
- One of the best things I ate on my trip there were soup dumplings. You can get soup dumplings in the US, but the ones I had were so delicious and had interesting flavor combinations.
